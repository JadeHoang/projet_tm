"2","What's a gom jabbar?  .","1"
"3"," She nodded .","1"
"4","    Pain .","1"
"5","    Pain! .","1"
"6","    But the pain -- he said .","1"
"7","You did that to my mother once?  .","1"
"8","And that's all there is to it -- pain? .","1"
"9","My son lives, she thought .","1"
"10","    Politics, he said .","1"
"11","A basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle: There it is, Piter -- the biggest mantrap in all history .","2"
"12","Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, I know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner .","2"
"13","You were wrong, eh, Mentat? .","2"
"14","    Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them? .","2"
"15","Get on with it, Piter .","2"
"16","Yueh, who is indeed our agent .","2"
"17","    Go ahead, tell him all of it, the Baron said .","2"
"18","No hint of this must ever reach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the Imperial House and there'd be chaos .","2"
"19","To begin, we'll have an irrevocable directorship in the CHOAM Company .","2"
"20","    The Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis .","2"
"21","Thus spoke St .","3"
"22","Alia-of-the-Knife: The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure .","3"
"23","For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness .","3"
"24","    Poor Paul, she whispered .","3"
"25","    The old woman's voice softened .","3"
"26","I've never even heard of a planet called Usul .","3"
"27","And I see that our fire  .","3"
"28","I've heard you talking to my mother .","3"
"29","    If there were a thing to be done for him, we'd have done it, the old woman growled .","3"
"30","But for your father, nothing .","3"
"31","    He stared across the big room bright with the light of noon pouring through the skylights, saw the boy seated with back to the door, intent on papers and charts spread across an ell table .","4"
"32","Shelter will mean a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view .","4"
"33","    Paul shrugged .","4"
"34","Yueh calls the Mystery of Life .","4"
"35","    Ah-h-h, hah! Gurney laughed, and he swung into Galacian Girls .","4"
"36","    What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry, Paul intoned .","4"
"37","    You see a need for an extra blade, eh? Halleck grunted  .","4"
"38","With each new shield contact, the smell of ozone grew stronger .","4"
"39","    Paul directed a parry downward, turned, saw Halleck's rapier catch against the table's edge .","4"
"40","He looked at the beet-colored inkvine scar on the man's jaw, remembering the story of how it had been put there by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave pit on Giedi Prime .","4"
"41","He felt excitement that his father would be coming .","5"
"42","    Yueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought: I salve my own conscience .","5"
"43","-from Muad'Dib, Family Commentaries by the Princess Irulan .","5"
"44","And he wondered: Why don't I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal my tongue? .","5"
"45","But almost anything else short of that    perhaps even dusting and a bit of soil poisoning .","5"
"46","    Disguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt, the Duke said .","5"
"47","The Fremen! .","5"
"48","    Don't the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?  .","5"
"49","    We're negotiating with the Fremen right now, Paul said .","5"
"50","The Harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges .","5"
"51","The arched ceiling stood two stories above her with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across space at monstrous cost .","6"
"52","    No .","6"
"53","    Let's not go into that again, he said .","6"
"54"," She glanced down at her dress .","6"
"55"," Jessica said .","6"
"56","Do you know its meaning?  .","6"
"57","Knife, that's Death Maker in Chakobsa .","6"
"58","    Eighe-e-e-e-e-e! Mapes wailed .","6"
"59","You are ours, she muttered .","6"
"60","More'n you drew with your puny scratch .","6"
"61","    Good afternoon .","7"
"62","The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious .","7"
"63","Yet another hole nearby produces the same result: a trickle that stops .","7"
"64","I've aroused her suspicions! Now I must use every trick my Wanna taught me .","7"
"65","The cargo handlers are his men .","7"
"66","It's not worthy .","7"
"67","The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets the flavor as pleasurable--slightly euphoric .","7"
"68","Jessica, if I asked a personal question? .","7"
"69","    She whirled, head up, glaring .","7"
"70"," And he thought: if only there were some way not to do this thing that I must do .","7"
"71","Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis .","8"
"72","The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed .","8"
"73","For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn .","8"
"74","And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn .","8"
"75","It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult .","8"
"76","Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson .","8"
"77","-from The Humanity of Muad'Dib by the Princess Irulan .","8"
"78","    Paul lay on the bed feigning sleep .","8"
"79","It had been easy to palm Dr .","8"
"80","Yueh's sleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it .","8"
"81","The rail felt cold under her sliding palm .","9"
"82","    Water everywhere in this room--on a planet where water was the most precious juice of life .","9"
"83","    Immerse it! she commanded  .","9"
"84","    He relaxed slightly .","9"
"85","    At once, sir .","9"
"86"," Again, his eyes swept the room .","9"
"87","He'll be shamed that    .","9"
"88","This message may have been meant to get to us .","9"
"89","    Other lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little yellows spaced out against blue darkness .","9"
"90","Time to be getting the young master to his father .","9"
"91","It is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit .","10"
"92","Would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily hoodwinked .","10"
"93","-from Muad'Dib: Family Commentaries by the Princess Irulan .","10"
"94","    The Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet of the landing control tower outside Arrakeen .","10"
"95","The night's first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung well above the southern horizon .","10"
"96","Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone like parched icing through a dust haze .","10"
"97","To his left, the lights of Arrakeen glowed in the haze--yellow    white    blue .","10"
"98","    He thought of the notices posted now above his signature all through the populous places of the planet: Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute .","10"
"99","    He saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from Arrakeen .","10"
"100"," 'Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work'  He turned, strode to the center of the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men .","10"
"101","    He knew he wasn't holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned, strode down the length of the long table and back .","11"
"102","And I blamed Hawat .","11"
"103","They're waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear to be dealing openly .","11"
"104","Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely because the Emperor ordered it?  .","11"
"105","    I don't like an unanswered question of this importance, Leto said .","11"
"106","And he thought: Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won't even be able to escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply to drive out such thoughts, said: Let's get to the working estimate .","11"
"107","We'll have to move fast with the Fremen .","11"
"108","Let us have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council and matters will be much different--profits or no profits .","11"
"109","We've been trained for it .","11"
"110","Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first .","11"
"111","On that first day when Muad'Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: Mahdi! But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World .","12"
"112","Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib .","12"
"113","-from Manual of Muad'Dib by the Princess Irulan .","12"
"114","    The Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard directed him .","12"
"115","There was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet .","12"
"116","The Duke glanced around as Hawat arose from a paper-cluttered table .","12"
"117","    M'Lord? .","12"
"118","Could a woman conspire against her own son? .","12"
"119"," Hawat extended a filmclip capsule .","12"
"120","    Some things beggar likeness, he thought .","12"
"121","There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man--with human flesh .","13"
"122","-from Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib by the Princess Irulan .","13"
"123","    The Duke said: Paul, I'm doing a hateful thing, but I must .","13"
"124"," He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast .","13"
"125","The thing's sensor arms hung limply over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead .","13"
"126","    The Duke's attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky .","13"
"127","    Paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen religious practices .","13"
"128","The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat's experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself .","13"
"129","    Mahdi! .","13"
"130","    Lisan al-Gaib! .","13"
"131","    His first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left Dr .","14"
"132","    They met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing field's administration building .","14"
"133","You speak only of possibilities .","14"
"134","    Indeed? And what is your work? .","14"
"135","We've waded in here with our mob of tame killers, eh? And we expect you to realize immediately that we're different from the Harkonnens? .","14"
"136","Do I hold the same course?  .","14"
"137","Rock outcroppings, perhaps .","14"
"138","Some parts of the desert teem with life .","14"
"139","Is this the regular working frequency, Kynes?  .","14"
"140","Cuts down interference .","14"
"141","This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions .","15"
"142","The classic central chandelier remained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the mechanism of the poison-snooper had been concealed .","15"
"143","    From behind the man, the Duke said: We haven't gone that far in our thinking, sir .","15"
"144","He spoke directly to Jessica: Do you bring the shortening of the way? .","15"
"145","    Leto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor, lights shot beams of reflection off it .","15"
"146","Consider it another toast--a toast to all who've died bringing us to this station .","15"
"147","    Halleck's music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor key, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood .","15"
"148","    We brought both from Caladan, she said .","15"
"149","She saw a handsignal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the walls move into positions of maximum guard  .","15"
"150","    Drowned? It was the stillsuit manufacturer's daughter .","15"
"151","    She slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her family was .","16"
"152","    There was one shouting, incoherent voice .","16"
"153","    Caffeine, Jessica said .","16"
"154","Let him sleep it off .","16"
"155","Their lieutenants are not strategically enough placed to consider .","16"
"156","    Let us discuss something else for a minute, then, she said .","16"
"157","    There could be many interpretations for your concern, Hawat said .","16"
"158","    A threat to my son got past you right here in this house, she said .","16"
"159","    Now he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, in dilation of nostrils, a steady stare .","16"
"160","    You accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions?  .","16"
"161","Do you wrestle with dreams?  .","17"
"162","Do you contend with shadows?  .","17"
"163","Do you move in a kind of sleep?  .","17"
"164","Time has slipped away  .","17"
"165","Your life is stolen  .","17"
"166","You tarried with trifles,  .","17"
"167","Victim of your folly .","17"
"168","-Dirge for Jamis on the Funeral Plain, from Songs of Muad'Dib by the Princess Irulan .","17"
"169","    What does it mean? he wondered .","17"
"170","It will be all that remains to you .","17"
"171","She thought of sitting up and turning on a light, but something stayed the decision .","18"
"172","She was on her side, hands tied behind her .","18"
"173"," the Baron said .","18"
"174","If you choose not to leave    he has other orders .","18"
"175","    He had been practicing the awareness-breathing, calming his mind, listening to their captors .","18"
"176","But it's one of them little liaison jobs .","18"
"177","    Kinet closed his door, bent to the controls .","18"
"178","    Kinet swiveled his seat .","18"
"179","    Has someone been at this 'thopter, preparing it for us? she wondered .","18"
"180","The Baron wants no witnesses .","18"
"181","Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife--chopping off what's incomplete and saying: Now, it's complete because it's ended here .","19"
"182","-from Collected Sayings of, Muad'Dib by the Princess Irulan .","19"
"183","    A man in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at the end of the hall, stared in at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes' body, the sprawled form of the Duke, Yueh standing there .","19"
"184","The man held a lasgun in his right hand .","19"
"185","There was a casual air of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a shiver through Yueh .","19"
"186","    Sardaukar, Yueh thought .","19"
"187","A Bashar by the look of him .","19"
"188","Probably one of the Emperor's own sent here to keep an eye on things .","19"
"189","No matter what the uniform, there's no disguising them .","19"
"190","    You're Yueh, the man said .","19"
"191","    The guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke's fighting men had retreated for a last-ditch stand .","20"
"192","    He adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against the pull of gravity .","20"
"193","    Yueh stood, swaying, His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice came in oddly measured cadence: You    think    you    de    feated    me .","20"
"194","Any word yet?  .","20"
"195","The chair beneath him took on firmness, the bindings were sharper .","20"
"196","    Leto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone's agony .","20"
"197","Perhaps on other portions of the body .","20"
"198","    The sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke's nerves .","20"
"199","    You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come, Piter said .","20"
"200","The tooth would end it all quickly .","20"
"201","He sat near his mother hugging his knees within a small fabric and plastic hutment--a stilltent--that had come, like the Fremen clothing they now wore, from the pack left in the 'thopter .","21"
"202","    Something had happened to his awareness this night--he saw with sharpened clarity every circumstance and occurrence around him .","21"
"203","Do not count on any of our people escaping .","21"
"204","She felt the slick-soft skin of the stillsuit against her body, thinking how their lives depended on these garments .","21"
"205","Bible .","21"
"206","    But the idea of living out his life in the mind-groping-ahead-through-possible-futures that guided hurtling spaceships appalled him .","21"
"207","    No, he said .","21"
"208","    His mother was beside him, holding his hands, her face a gray blob peering at him .","21"
"209","    What have you done to me? he demanded .","21"
"210","I've just had a waking dream .","21"
"211","When my father, the Padishah Emperor, heard of Duke Leto's death and the manner of it, he went into such a rage as we had never before seen .","22"
"212","He blamed my mother and the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne .","22"
"213","He blamed the Guild and the evil old Baron .","22"
"214","He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said I was a witch like all the others .","22"
"215","And when I sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self-preservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and asked if I thought him a weakling .","22"
"216","I saw then that he had been aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all royalty .","22"
"217","As I look back on it, I think there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and Muad'Dib's shared common ancestry .","22"
"218","-In My Father's House, by the Princess Irulan .","22"
"219","    Now Harkonnen shall kill Harkonnen, Paul whispered .","22"
"220","    He had awakened shortly before nightfall, sitting up in the sealed and darkened stilltent .","22"
"221","You can't stop analyzing your data .","23"
"222","There had been a warm wind just before dawn, but now it was cold .","23"
"223","   worm .","23"
"224","    What do you fear? the Fremen demanded .","23"
"225","He said: Did you come here seeking information about the big guns?  .","23"
"226","Which legion? Do you know?  .","23"
"227","    You are pledged to his water? .","23"
"228","    Why did you not say at first it was a water matter? The Fremen stood up, seated his nose plugs firmly .","23"
"229","    Behind Hawat, a man cursed .","23"
"230","He started to draw it .","23"
"231","He tells us The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door .","24"
"232","Idaho was out of his 'thopter and running toward them before the dust settled .","24"
"233","Instruments lined the bench--dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them .","24"
"234","    You sense that Arrakis could be a paradise, Kynes said .","24"
"235","    Kynes met Paul's stare and, presently, said: No Harkonnen ever admitted error .","24"
"236","Yet the Harkon--  .","24"
"237","He herded them into the darkness, closed the door .","24"
"238","Follow the arrows like that one on the floor .","24"
"239","My people have done this in stealing 'thopters .","24"
"240","Their way slanted downward for a time, then up, ever up .","24"
"241","Here in his quarters, though, the ship's harsh metal was disguised with draperies, with fabric paddings and rare art objects  .","25"
"242","    The Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud's eyes .","25"
"243","    He has spoken only enough, m'Lord, to reveal his belief that the Lady Jessica was his betrayer .","25"
"244","    Don't be dense, Nefud .","25"
"245","    Rabban advanced another step, thinking that the damnable old man had deliberately removed all chairs, forcing a visitor to stand .","25"
"246","But family punishments could be painful .","25"
"247","    Ah-h-h, I see, Rabban murmured .","25"
"248","He felt betrayed .","25"
"249","When last you ruled this place, I held you in strong rein .","25"
"250","    But you-- .","25"
"251","    I must find the right vortex, he thought .","26"
"252","    The vortex turned them, twisting, tipping .","26"
"253","    Jessica leaped off the 'thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune .","26"
"254","Jessica followed .","26"
"255","    It'd have to be sounds without rhythm, Jessica said .","26"
"256","But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open desert .","26"
"257","    Another cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips .","26"
"258","She won't smother immediately .","26"
"259","    Presently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he found the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there .","26"
"260","    In that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left beyond the end of the fissure .","26"
"261","We came from Caladan--a paradise world for our form of fife .","27"
"262","There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind--we could see the actuality all around us .","27"
"263","And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life--we went soft, we lost our edge .","27"
"264","He could see his own reflection now in a dark surface beside the smuggler and scowled at the lines of fatigue in his lumpy face .","27"
"265","    In your mood, I'm not sure we want you to stay .","27"
"266","    Haven't you heard that there may've been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?  .","27"
"267","Arrakis isn't what they thought it'd be .","27"
"268","    Halleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to stand were standing--no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them .","27"
"269","    The Atreides training--We care for our own!--it held like a core of native rock in them, Halleck noted .","27"
"270","They have no bone and organ banks here--only outpost medicine .","27"
"271","We will save her as a gift .","28"
"272","He heard her soft progress and the cold single-grain dribbles of sound--the desert's own code spelling out its measure of safety .","28"
"273","Here was action that could be understood .","28"
"274","    Jessica crouched staring .","28"
"275","    Why would they call a worm? Jessica asked .","28"
"276","    We have other senses than eyes, she said .","28"
"277","He stared down through smoke bushes and weeds into a wedged slab sand-surface of moonlight inhabited by an up-hop, jump, pop-hop of tiny motion  .","28"
"278","    We needed that reminder, Jessica thought .","28"
"279","There was a low humming of light here more basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe .","28"
"280","    Paul, less conditioned to emergency response than his mother, felt chagrin that he had stiffened and tried to withdraw, that he had clouded his abilities by a momentary panic .","28"
"281","This Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize as The Pillars of the Universe, whose Qizara Tafwid are among us all with signs and proofs and prophecy .","29"
"282","They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose profound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms, but stamped with the new awakening .","29"
"283","Who has not heard and been deeply moved by The Old Man's Hymn?  .","29"
"284","And was caught on their beaks and claws! .","29"
"285","    His fingers clawed feebly at the sand  .","29"
"286","    Kynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it .","29"
"287","An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties .","29"
"288","Abruptly, it straightened, stretched its head upward and with a single screech, leaped into the air and banked away overhead with its companions behind it .","29"
"289","    Then he heard the sand rumbling .","29"
"290","A gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide was forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous blow with a dust whirlpool at its center .","29"
"291","    Scrambling sounds came from the rocks--above and to both sides    dark motions in the moonlight .","30"
"292","This child-man interests me .","30"
"293","I must get to a safe vantage point where I can threaten them and give her time to escape .","30"
"294","    There came a whispered imprecation from above Paul and a low voice: Call me spawn of a lizard! But the shadow pulled back out of view .","30"
"295","There had been a place called Sietch Tabr on the chart and beside it the notation: Stilgar .","30"
"296","    The two men Stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled and gasped between them .","30"
"297","    Paul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft, slipped the Fremen weapon back into his sash .","30"
"298","    I would not have permitted you to harm my companions, she said .","30"
"299","Kushti bakka te .","30"
"300","And she thought: They travel as a military company--even the girl, Chani .","30"
"301","Less chance of losing the whole troop .","31"
"302","I'd advise you against this because they'd not follow you .","31"
"303","Would he try to limit the necessities that a Bene Gesserit must follow? .","31"
"304","But it does not follow that justice is always the thing a people needs .","31"
"305","This was a time for boldness on her part, and she realized what she needed: some dar al-hikman, some school of translation that would give her     .","31"
"306","She recognized the sensation with a quickening of pulse .","31"
"307","Mine enemies are like green blades eaten down  .","31"
"308","They are like birds scattered by the huntsman  .","31"
"309","The prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place .","31"
"310","    In grasping the present, he felt for the first time the massive steadiness of time's movement everywhere complicated by shifting currents, waves, surges, and countersurges, like surf against rocky cliffs .","31"
"311","You must remember that he was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back into the dimmest history .","32"
"312","    She realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of great fatigue, and this suggested something of her own unconscious assessment on personal security within Stilgar's troop .","32"
"313","    Yes .","32"
"314","    Stop calling her Sayyadina! Jamis said .","32"
"315","    Now, Paul! Now! Jessica screamed it in her mind .","32"
"316","    Now the two figures on the rock floor circled each other; Jamis with knife hand held far forward and tipped up slightly; Paul crouched with knife held low .","32"
"317","    Paul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed .","32"
"318","He sees that this is not like a child of his own people, but a fighting machine born and trained to it from infancy .","32"
"319","But she saw the way her son moved, the beads of perspiration on his face and shoulders, the careful wariness visible in the flow of muscles .","32"
"320","    Killing with the point lacks artistry, Idaho had once told Paul, but don't let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself .","32"
"321","She knew her trained awareness soon would give her what these Fremen obviously had--the ability to sense even the slightest change in the air's moisture .","33"
"322","    She looked out at the Arrakeen sunset, at the banked decks of color in the sky .","33"
"323","Jamis' weapon has been killed .","33"
"324","    Leader's right, the troop intoned .","33"
"325","Where I am dew be thou the water .","33"
"326","One by one, she took the others, showing each to Paul, counting them .","33"
"327","    It was like a child's game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands .","33"
"328","That air felt damp, he said  .","33"
"329","She saw how the Fremen slowed while passing the honeycomb lattice, felt the dampness of the air as she came opposite it .","33"
"330","    A splashing sounded on her left .","33"
"331","    But off the main way, Count Fenring and his lady noted the rubbish heaps, the scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the streets, and the furtive scurrying of the people .","34"
"332","    They were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family games .","34"
"333","    Each day, some time each hour, brings change, she said .","34"
"334","    I wouldn't think of it! .","34"
"335","    Dare the Emperor charge me with treason before a full Landsraad Council? And the Baron held his breath with the hope of it  .","34"
"336","    And what science is that? the Baron asked .","34"
"337","They were so many pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a flutter of colorful clothing and banners .","34"
"338","    The slow march began, sonorous with its ancient pomp, and Feyd-Rautha led his troupe across the arena for obeisance at the foot of his uncle's box .","34"
"339","    No one will harm the lad, the Baron said .","34"
"340","    The Baron pushed himself from his chair, settled his weight into his suspensors .","34"
"341","    The troop stopped, and Paul sensed abrupt tension .","35"
"342","    She returned his stare .","35"
"343","The stone floor was smooth, swept clean of sand .","35"
"344","And they'll find their share of death in the sand .","35"
"345","    Paul glanced at the openings in the tunnel walls, seeing the heavy carpets on the raised ledge, glimpses of rooms with bright fabrics on the walls, piled cushions .","35"
"346","He felt a sudden reluctance to be alone with this woman .","35"
"347","The butchers have yet to penetrate to our region .","35"
"348","    Get the food, he said .","35"
"349","He stood there a moment caught by uncertainty .","35"
"350","    There was no sign of a poison snooper here, no indication of their use anywhere in the cave warren .","35"
"351","She estimated there were more than five thousand people gathered out there beneath the ledge where she stood with Stilgar  .","36"
"352","    The decision stands, she said .","36"
"353","    Chani led the old Reverend Mother to a rock bench deep in the acoustical horn, returned to stand beside Stilgar .","36"
"354","She rested a hand on her abdomen, thinking of the unborn daughter there, asking herself: Do I have the right to risk us both? .","36"
"355","    This changes both of you! Holy Mother, what have we done?  .","36"
"356","I have much to give you .","36"
"357","    Jessica sensed the daughter-mote still touching her inner awareness, probed it without response .","36"
"358","    A tiny outflowing of love-comfort, like a reflection of what she had poured into it, came from the other mote .","36"
"359","I could take away the drug action and make it harmless .","36"
"360","    Oh, the wailing Jessica sensed in that parting .","36"
"361","    Nefud! the Baron roared  .","37"
"362","    Feyd-Rautha went pale, took a step forward .","37"
"363","    Ah, yes, the Baron said .","37"
"364","And as he had done many times since that terrible day on Arrakis, he found himself regretting the loss of Piter, the Mentat .","37"
"365","Well, Feyd, as for you: I'm setting Thufir Hawat to watch over you .","37"
"366","    Uncle, I don't understand you .","37"
"367","    I've learned much from Hawat, Feyd-Rautha agreed, and felt the truth of the words as he spoke them .","37"
"368","Hawat is subtle .","37"
"369","The poison's in him .","37"
"370","Uncle, you --  .","37"
"371","It is not enough that you say to me the Emperor is in a ferment about some association between Arrakis and his mysterious prison planet .","38"
"372","    We both know the figure for storm accretion, Hawat said .","38"
"373","    At my nephew's birthday several years ago, the Baron said .","38"
"374","What did Fenring say?  .","38"
"375","    The Baron turned his hands palms up .","38"
"376","Tell Rabban he either meets the spice quotas you set him or he'll be replaced .","38"
"377","    Of course he will! Hawat snapped .","38"
"378","    The Baron could not keep the sly tone of admiration out of his voice .","38"
"379","Production will drop off .","38"
"380","But it's well known that repression makes a religion flourish .","38"
"381","In such perfection, all things move toward death .","39"
"382","It was a kind of visual fatigue and it came, he knew, from the constant necessity of holding the prescient future as a kind of memory that was in itself a thing intrinsically of the past .","39"
"383","The wide-set green eyes, though, hid beneath their over-casting of spice-imbued blue .","39"
"384","We observe the rites .","39"
"385","    And what did my mother say to them? .","39"
"386","The imperfect vision plagued him .","39"
"387","Now, I must be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the Chronicles .","39"
"388","The dark niches of his eyes remained steady on Paul with their untamed stare .","39"
"389","Jessica returned her attention to Harah .","39"
"390","    Again Alia stirred beside her, half-sleeping, warm .","39"
"391","    And he had answered correctly: Half a meter for every meter of the maker's diameter .","40"
"392","When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and into positions ahead .","40"
"393","    A sense of inevitable dignity enfolded Stilgar as he pulled his robe tightly around him .","40"
"394","    Real pain exposed itself in Paul's voice .","40"
"395","    Paul whirled .","40"
"396","    One small 'thopter, Stilgar said .","40"
"397","    At this distance we're just a worm on the surface, Stilgar said .","40"
"398","    Stilgar nodded, dropped down the side on his hooks, leaped onto the sand .","40"
"399","He landed running, lunged against the slipface of a dune the way he had been taught, and hid himself beneath the cascade of sand over his robe  .","40"
"400","    True .","40"
"401","    In the con-bubble of the factory, Gurney Halleck leaned forward, adjusted the oil lenses of his binoculars and examined the landscape .","41"
"402","The ridge offered some shielding and protection .","41"
"403","Only the eyes of the fighting man ahead of him were visible to Gurney between hood and veil of a sand-colored burnoose, but the crouch and readiness warned him that here was a trained fighting man .","41"
"404","    And Paul: Gurney, man! Gurney, man! .","41"
"405","    I understand it well enough, Gurney said .","41"
"406","He speaks of himself as one of them .","41"
"407","You're the only one left me    to think you dead .","41"
"408","    Where did the men go on the maker? Paul asked  .","41"
"409","Gurney, he said, are there many Guildsmen around Rabban? .","41"
"410","They're buying spice as though it were the most precious thing in the universe .","41"
"411","She felt rested after the long journey up from the south, but still rankled that Paul would not yet permit them to use the captured ornithopters .","42"
"412","    She studied her son, wondering why he had not yet trotted out his surprise -- Gurney Halleck .","42"
"413","    This is a dangerous way to do it, Jessica thought, but she remembered the message cylinder and what it implied .","42"
"414","I am your ruler, and I say to you that it is time we stopped killing off our best men and started killing our real enemies -- the Harkonnens! .","42"
"415","Knowing it, her mind churned .","42"
"416","    Paul's hand slipped to his knife hilt .","42"
"417","    This is a trick, Gurney snarled, and his arm tightened on Jessica's throat .","42"
"418","My father showed it to me the night he explained why it had to be a Harkonnen trick aimed at making him suspect the woman he loved .","42"
"419","    Gurney's arm trembled against her neck .","42"
"420"," There was no special command in the words, no trick to play on his weaknesses, but Gurney's hand fell away .","42"
"421","    A great figure loomed out of the rocks above her, beckoning for speed .","43"
"422","    I signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants, Jessica said .","43"
"423","The answering grip was painful in its intensity .","43"
"424","    Jessica glared at her .","43"
"425","    A moment for you, three weeks of fear for me, Jessica said .","43"
"426","    Tired, Jessica whispered .","43"
"427","    The strong young arms felt so good to Jessica .","43"
"428","Her mind still rolled and surged from the contact .","43"
"429","Otheym would speak of what he had seen and heard .","43"
"430","Think of that! The finest Guild navigators, men who can quest ahead through time to find the safest course for the fastest Heighliners, all of them seeking me   and unable to find me .","43"
"431","We like it not, your exposing yourself, Muad'Dib .","44"
"432","They know it there, too .","44"
"433","It's what he actually does .","44"
"434","    A great commotion, Muad'Dib, the watcher hissed .","44"
"435","Paul restored the cover, said: Start sending our men down, Stil .","44"
"436","Gurney stayed beside him .","44"
"437","    Paul came to his senses, feeling the sand needles sting his exposed cheeks .","44"
"438","    Another signalman sat there at his equipment  .","44"
"439","Is the way down to the basin still open? Paul asked .","44"
"440","    The message is garbled, Gurney said .","44"
"441","There was that same look of the predatory bird .","45"
"442","They crop up regularly on the fringes of civilization .","45"
"443","Got away! You hear that? .","45"
"444","He leaned forward, put a hand on her head, stared at the Baron .","45"
"445","    My brother knows I'm here, Alia said .","45"
"446","This play has gone far enough .","45"
"447","You    you    .","45"
"448","    Something sparkled to his left .","45"
"449","    His words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the shipwall behind the Emperor trembled and rocked .","45"
"450","The man had lost one of his masking contact lenses, and the eye stared out a total blue so dark as to be almost black .","45"
"451","    It was to the Arrakeen governor's mansion, the old Residency the Atreides had first occupied on Dune, that they escorted Paul-Muad'Dib on the evening of his victory .","46"
"452","He glanced around at the beams and the high, slitted windows .","46"
"453","    The Sardaukar's eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock .","46"
"454","It was a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost-wind of the jihad in it .","46"
"455","Thufir Hawat's with 'em, m'Lord .","46"
"456","    Why should I fear that man? he wondered .","46"
"457","    Hawat's gaze stabbed past Paul, and the old man said: Lady Jessica, I but learned this day how I've wronged you in my thoughts .","46"
"458","Anything at all .","46"
"459","    He glanced at her, saw the fear for him in her eyes .","46"
"460","    Please stand aside, Paul said .","46"
